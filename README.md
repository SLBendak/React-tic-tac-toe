# React-tic-tac-toe
## Description 
created simple tic-tac-toe game that allowed the player to go back to any turn by saving the history of turns taken. Built using React framework.

## Technologies used
- React

## What i learned:
- importing components and react are required for the seperate files to interact together.

- the difference between function and class components.

- that props is the default data stored in a variable and that state is the modified information based on user interaction.

- How to utilize both onClick and the onChange pseudo event.

- return() within the component is what will display inside a given component when its route is called to.

- constructor functions have fallen out of favor replaced by the cleaner.
```
state = {
    object: true
}
```

- handle event functions determine what happens to the state when the event is triggered.

- export default "component name" is required at the end of a js file so it can be properly called to from another page.
